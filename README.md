Modelling and data analysis exercices for the computational neuroscience course
http://cneuro.rmki.kfki.hu/education/neuromodel


Exercices are organised in 4 folders, corresponding to the 4 blocks of the course. You need to complete 1 exercise per block.

Each exercise is an R Markdown file - with extension Rmd. You can also view the pdf, which contains the R code and the description of the problem.

To complete the exercise, read the problem, perform the simulation/analysis, interpret the results and submit a single pdf file.

1. Biophysics

* ions_demo.RMD: Nernst equation and membrane potential 
* HH_demo.Rmd: excitability of the Hodgkin-Huxley model
* IF_demo.Rmd: simplified neuron models

2. Coding

* Coding_demo.Rmd: Variability of neuronal responses
* Decoding_demo.Rmd: Bayesian decoding
* Networks.Rmd: dynamics of balanced networks

3. Synapse - Learning

* Relyability_demo.Rmd: estimating the effect of synaptic (un)reliability
* Perceptron.Rmd: classification with the perceptron - overfitting and cross-validation

4. Hippocampus

* Hopfield.Rmd: energy function, capacity and biological realstic memory networks
* PlaceCells.RMd: place cells recorded from a freely moving rat - information rate, reliability and decoding
