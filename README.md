Programming exercices for the computational neuroscience course
http://cneuro.rmki.kfki.hu/education/neuromodel

The excercices are centered around 'demos'. Each demo explores a particular neuronal phenomenon. 
To quickly get to the exercices run the file 'run_demo.R' to run the demos in R (https://www.r-project.org) or Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com)

Details: 
each demo has three separate R files with the following structure:
xxx_demo.R: interface for the demo. Sets the parameters, runs the simulations and plots the result. 
xxx_sim.R: defines the simulations.
xxx_consts.R: defining constants.
